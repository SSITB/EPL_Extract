# EPL_Extract
Extract datasets for a football team of your choice, with various types of useful information.

<h2>Description</h2>
This script, in its current format takes your football team and year as input, and extracts all matches played by the team with relevant information, such as score, formations, lineups, and stats.
The project is in its most basic implementation sofar, but in the near future, I will be extracting events per match, including goals, assists, cards, and substitutions. Long-term, I hope to be able to extract more detailed statistics per match, as well as develop a user-friendly GUI.
